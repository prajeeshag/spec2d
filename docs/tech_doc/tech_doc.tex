\title{Spectral Transforms}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

In a spectral global model one part of the computations are made in spectral space (horizontal derivatives, semi-implicit time stepping, horizontal diffusion), and the other part in grid-point space on a grid defined by a Gaussian quadrature. It is therefore necessary to perform spectral transforms from spectral space to gird-point space and vice-versa. The present chapter aims at giving the details of the spectral method used in IITM's Atmospheric Model.

\section{Spectral Representation}
The spectral representation of a state variable $A$ on a given vertical layer above the surface of a sphere is definded by an approximation to the variable by truncated series of spherical harmonics using a triangular truncation at wavenumber N, given as:
\begin{equation}
A(\lambda,\mu) = \sum_{m=0}^N \sum_{n=|m|}^{N} A_{n}^{m} P_{n}^{m} (\mu) e^{im\lambda}
\end{equation}
 where $\mu=sin\theta$, $\theta$ is latitude, $\lambda$ is longitude, and $P_{n}^{m}(\mu)$ is the associated Legendre function, $m$ is the fourier wave number.
Transforming from grid-point space to spectral space involves performing an fourier transform for each line of constant latitude, 
\begin{equation}
A_{m}(\mu) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} A(\lambda,\mu) e^{-im\lambda} d\lambda
\end{equation}

followed by a integral over latitudes using a Gaussian quadrature to obtain the spherical harmonics,

\begin{equation}
A_{n}^{m} = \sum_{j=1}^{J} A^{m}(\mu_j)P_{n}^{m}(\mu_j) \omega_j
\end{equation}
where, $A^m$ is the mth Fourier coefficient, $\omega_j$ is the Gaussian quadrature weight corresponding to Gaussian latitude $\mu_j$ and $J$ total number of latitudes.
The fourier transforms performed numerically by using Fast Fourier Transfroms.

\section{Horizontal Derivatives}
\subsection{Meridional derivative relative to latitude $\theta$ }
For a variable A, meridional derivative can be derived from from spectral space using two methods. First method is using the formula:
\begin{equation}
\left(\cos\theta\pdv{A}{\theta}\right)_{n}^m = -(n-1)e_{n}^m A_{n-1}^m + 
(n+2)e_{n+1}^m A_{n+1}^m
\end{equation}
where, $e_0^0=0$ and $e_n^m = \sqrt{\frac{n^2-m^2}{4n^2-1}}$. And second method is using formula for transformation from spectral to grid point space:
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta\pdv{A}{\theta} = \sum_{m=0}^{N} \sum_{n=|m|}^{N} A_{n}^{m} H_{n}^{m} (\mu) e^{im\lambda}
\end{equation}
where, $H_n^m(\mu) = -ne_{n+1}^m P_{n+1}^m(\mu) + (n+1)e_n^m P_{n-1}^m(\mu)$.

\subsection{Zonal derivative relative to longitude $\lambda$}
For a variable A , zonal derivative is discretized in spectral space by the
following formula:
\begin{equation}
\left(\pdv{A}{\lambda}\right)_n^m = imA_n^m
\end{equation}
This can also be derived from multiplication of $im$ on fourier coefficients.

\section{Relationship between dimension in spectral space and grid point space}
Spectral space is defined by a triangular truncation $N$. Grid point space has $NLAT$ latitudes and maximum number of longitudes equal to $MAXLON$. $NLAT$ and $MAXLON$ are always even integers, where $MAXLON=20+(NLAT/2-1)*4$.

For a quadratic Gaussian grid, the relationship between spectral space and grid point space to avoid aliasing on quadratic terms is given by $N \leq (2*NLAT-1)/3$.
In a semi-Lagrangian scheme as the advective quadratic terms disappear, it is possible to use a linear Gaussian grid, which has a relation $N \leq NLAT-1$.
For a cubic Gaussian grid, the relationship is $N \leq NLAT/2 -1 $

\section{Octahedral reduced Gaussian grid}
To save memory and computation time (in particular in the physical parametrizations) and to maintain a quasi-isotropic grid the number of longitudes per latitude circle is reduced as we move towards the poles from equator. 
The method used to reduce the number of grid points towards pole is inspired by a regular triangular mapping onto an octahedron, which corresponds to a reduction of 4 points per latitude circle, one per face of the octahedron \cite{malardel_new_2016}. The resulting grid is called the "octahedral reduced gaussian grid". The octahedral reduced Gaussian grid can be generated using the formula: $NLON_j = NLON_{pole} + 4*(jj-1)$, where $jj=j$, if $j \leq NLAT/2$, else $jj=NLAT-j+1$, $j$ is latitude index, $NLON_{pole}$ is the number of grid points at first latitude near to pole, $NLON_j$ is the number of grid points at $j$th latitude. In general, $NLON_{pole}$ is taken as 20. Figure \ref{figone} gives an example of octahedral reduced grid with $NLON_{pole} = 4$ and $NLAT=16$.

	\caption{A schematic representation of octahedral reduced grid with 16 number of latitude ($NLAT=16$) circles and the no: of longitude points at the latitude circle nearest to the pole is 4 ($NLON_{pole}=4$). The colors represent latitude index, a negative index is southern hemisphere and positive is northern hemisphere. Numbers inside the grid boxes are longitude index.}

\section{Packed-grid}
The subsection titles must be in boldface, 12pt, flush left.

\section{Figures and Captions}
\label{sec:captionmargins}
Figures and tables captions should be centered if less than one line
(Figure~\ref{figone}), otherwise justified and indented by 0.8cm on
both margins, as shown in Figure~\ref{figtwo}. The font must be
Helvetica, 10~point, boldface, with 6~points of space before and after
each caption.



In tables, do not use colored or shaded backgrounds, and avoid thick,
doubled, or unnecessary framing lines. When reporting empirical data,
do not use more decimal digits than warranted by their precision and
reproducibility. Table caption must be placed before the table (see
Table~\ref{tabone}) and the font used must also be Helvetica,
10~point, boldface, with 6~points of space before and after each
caption.

Figure and table references must be composed by the chapter number and
a sequence number beginning in one (see the examples of
Figure~\ref{figone}, Figure~\ref{figtwo} and Table~\ref{tabone}).
