	abstract = {The accuracy of computed solutions to several formulations of the shallow-water equations is compared. The shallow-water equations can be written in a number of different forms that are obtained by (a) combining terms into differential expressions; (b) raising the order of the differential equations, for example, the vorticity–divergence formulation, and (c) transforming both independent and dependent variables. Although the exact solutions to the formulations are identical, the properties of the computed solutions vary depending on the formulation and the method of solution. Nine methods are examined, all of which provide satisfactory accuracy for a steady-state test case. The exact solution corresponds to a steady zonal wind that is tilted relative to the computational spherical coordinate system. The resulting wind passes over the North Pole, providing a test of the “pole problem.” Computational details are presented as well as the accuracy of a 5-day computation in both 32- and 64-bit arithmetic. Stability and accuracy are shown to depend on the polar smoothing induced by resynthesis, which is also the accepted method for eliminating nonlinear aliasing. Eight of the nine methods mimic the exact solution by computing a numerical steady-state solution.},

	abstract = {Previous tests with grid-point numerical weather prediction models have shown that semi-Lagrangian schemes permit the use of time steps that are much larger than those permitted by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criterion for the corresponding Eulerian models, without reducing the accuracy of the forecasts. Thus model efficiency is improved because fewer time steps are needed to complete the forecast. In a first step to see if similar results can be achieved in spectral models, Ritchie, in a previous study, applied interpolating and noninterpolating semi-Lagrangian treatments of advection to the problem of simple advection by a steady wind field on a Gaussian grid. This present paper combines these treatments of advection with the semi-implicit scheme in a spectral model of the shallow water equations expressed in vector momentum form. Model formulations are presented and intercomparison experiments are performed. It is shown that both interpolating and noninterpolating semi-Lagrangian schemes can be applied accurately and stably to a spectral model of the shallow water equations with time steps that are much larger than the CFL limit for the corresponding Eulerian model.},
